Hey another day another rom, that's what you might be thinking. but we at stag (I'll try not to use big words, because the idea is to be simple) aim at something towards elegance. We are learners just like everyone out there, This is small something we have started which helps us learn every single day. Why Stag, you might question, my answer would be why not. After all Harry's patronus was a stag(pun intended). Anyway, so the aim here is to provide a really good experience to everyone who uses, everyone on telegram channel can contact us and request, everything will be considered, because if you as users feel something missing, it obviously must be missing. So looking forward for people using our StagOS and giving us all your precious feedback. 
~Sic Parvis Magna~
PS: for people wondering what sic parvis magna is, it translates to great endings from small beginnings, Something i picked up while playing a game.
Credits where they are Due:
Google(No explanation needed n this regards)
Lineage(For starting of the custom rom war)
KCUF Rom(For acting as base)
Omni Rom, Slim Rom, DirtyUnicorns, AospExtended and every other project whose contributions lead to many of the features present.

Whatever Features you find in first build there's no guarantee that they will carry on to the subsequent builds.
As 69+ features help only to boast, and this ROM over here is not only meant for that. We want you to boast but not by the features, We want you to fall in love with the touch. So here I'll be adding up the features that i intend on adding/removing. we are starting of with many features just to find out what you like/what you don't.
